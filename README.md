# qDot

A Python-based playground for classical mechanics, built while I pretend to be a Lagrangian wizard. Each file in this repo contains a specific mechanical system from John R. Taylor’s Classical Mechanics, solved using the Lagrangian formalism, and plotted for your viewing pleasure. I did this while I took the Classical Mechanics class in my college, for fun of course.

## What’s inside
- Systems with generalized coordinates
- Equations of motion derived from Euler–Lagrange equations
- Beautiful trajectory plots (2D, 3D, maybe even 11D someday)
- Animations, because watching particles move > solving integrals

## Tech
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`
- `matplotlib.animation`

## Why?
Because `F = ma` is too mainstream.  :)  
And because the principle of least action deserves the most attention.

## Inspired from
Problems and systems inspired by  
*Classical Mechanics* by John R. Taylor.

## Usage
Clone the repo, pick a system, run the script, watch the magic.
